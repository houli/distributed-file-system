* Replication Across File Nodes
Replication of documents occurs when a file write happens to a primary. The
primary looks up the other nodes registered in the system. It then chooses one
of them randomly to serve as a secondary witness to the write and tells it to
replicate the file contents. This happens on a lightweight asynchronous thread
so that the user can receive the response from the primary that the primary
write has happened while the replication occurs in the background between
services.

In this scheme, the primary node now has failover should it ever go down. We
have ensured that writes that occur on a primary have at least 1 other copy and
that the copy is placed on another node that is also visible to directory
servers within the system. This is important as we do not want replication
across nodes that are no longer reachable by directory services due to crashes
or network partitioning.
